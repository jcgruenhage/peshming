## peshming
It's a prometheus exporter pinging hosts in the background.
It's been inspired by [meshping](https://bitbucket.org/Svedrin/meshping),
but instead of managing targets using a redis db this is using a simple config file.
In addition, this tool allows to set a ping frequency per target.

The name peshming is intended as a placeholder until
someone comes up with something better.
